The parent and child in separated indexes, but the update only needs to update the parent event "variables" key

The "variables" field changes a lot, it depends in what "processId" it has and many may not being defined yet, I don't know how to handle that tbh

The update will take place in the variables of the "kogitoprocinstanceid", targeting the "variableName" with the "variableValue".  "kogitoprocinstanceid" and "processInstanceId" in the update event are equivalent

You can safely assume that any missing value with null or array would be either a String or a String array

So any null variable == string, any empty array string[]
